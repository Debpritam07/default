# Consumer Complaint Text Classification

## Overview
This project is aimed at building a robust text classification system that automatically categorizes consumer complaints into specific groups based on the content of the complaint narratives. The primary objective is to assist organizations in efficiently handling a large volume of customer complaints, enabling them to quickly address customer concerns and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from the [Consumer Complaint Database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database). This dataset contains a wealth of information, including the date of complaint receipt, product details, issue descriptions, consumer complaint narratives, and more. These attributes are leveraged for training and evaluating the text classification models.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- We begin by collecting a comprehensive dataset of consumer complaints. Each complaint includes essential information, such as the nature of the issue and the product or service associated with it.

### 2. Data Exploration
- We perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of complaints across various categories. This exploration phase helps us understand the dataset's characteristics.

### 3. Text Pre-processing
- The complaint text undergoes rigorous pre-processing steps, including:
  - Conversion to lowercase: All text is converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
  - Special character removal: Numbers and punctuation are removed from the text.
  - Tokenization: The text is split into individual words, making it suitable for analysis.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- To enhance the model's understanding of the text data, we create relevant features. One example is the calculation of term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scores for words in each complaint.

### 5. Model Selection
- We explore various machine learning models suitable for text classification. In this project, we focus on three primary models:
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### 6. Model Training
- Each selected model is trained using labeled complaint data. The models learn to identify patterns in the complaint narratives and classify them into appropriate categories.

### 7. Model Evaluation
- The performance of each trained model is rigorously assessed using a range of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This evaluation phase helps us identify the model that performs best for our specific task.

### 8. Prediction
- The top-performing model is used to predict the category of new consumer complaints as they come in. This automated categorization process streamlines issue resolution and enhances customer satisfaction.
